Consider the 3-byte sequence 11100000 10000000 10100001. Answer the following questions:

What code point does it encode in UTF-8, and what character is that?
What are the three other ways to encode that character?
Give an example of a character that has exactly three encodings (but not four, like the one in the previous example does)
What are some problems with having these multiple encodings, especially for ASCII characters? A web search for “overlong UTF-8 encoding” may be useful here.
